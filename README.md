DCIT 50 – Java Programming Laboratory Portfolio

This repository contains all laboratory activities completed for the course DCIT 50 – Object-Oriented Programming.
The activities demonstrate my progress in Java programming, starting from basic syntax and concepts up to object-oriented programming principles and simple system implementations.

LABORATORY ACTIVITIES:
Laboratory Activity #1 – Java Programming Review

A review of basic Java programming concepts, including syntax, input/output, and program flow.

    . Variables and data types

    . Loops and conditional statements

    . Methods and basic code organization

    . Basic input and output

Laboratory Activity #2 – Working with Java Classes

Introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming through class creation and object usage.

    . Class and object creation

    . Constructors

    . Instance variables and methods

    . Basic OOP concepts

Laboratory Activities #3 and #4 – Coffee Shop System

Implements a simple coffee shop ordering system using object-oriented programming principles.

    . Default and parameterized constructors

    . Use of the this keyword

    . Static variables and methods

    . Encapsulation

Laboratory Activity #5 – School Management System (Inheritance and Aggregation)

Models a school management system using class relationships and inheritance.

    . Inheritance (extends)

    . IS-A and HAS-A relationships

    . Aggregation

    . Use of the super keyword

Laboratory Activity #6 – School Management System (Polymorphism)

Enhances the system by applying polymorphism to manage different object behaviors.

    . Method overriding

    . Polymorphism

    . Parent and child class references

    . Dynamic binding

Laboratory Activity #7 – Order Management System

Develops an order management system using advanced Java features and collections.

    . Encapsulation

    . Enums

    . Packages

    . ArrayList and Iterator
