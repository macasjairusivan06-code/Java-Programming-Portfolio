DCIT 50 – Java Programming Laboratory Portfolio
Introduction

This repository contains my laboratory activities for the DCIT 50 – Java Programming course.
These activities demonstrate my understanding of Java fundamentals, including variables, arrays, loops, conditionals, switch-case statements, and method-based program design. The progression of the labs reflects my development from basic Java concepts to more structured and modular programs.

Laboratory Activities
Laboratory 1: Java Review – Library Book Management System

A console-based Java program developed as a laboratory examination.

The program simulates a basic Campus Library Book Management System that helps track book borrowing activities. It uses arrays to store book titles and availability status, with a maximum limit of five books.

Main features include:

     . Displaying a menu using a switch-case statement

     . Adding new books with a default status of Available

     . Updating book status by toggling between Available and Borrowed

     . Displaying all registered books with their status

     . Generating a simple report showing total, available, and borrowed books

     . Handling invalid inputs and exiting the program gracefully

This laboratory focuses on arrays, loops, conditionals, input validation, and modular coding using methods.

Final Project

The final project applies the concepts learned throughout the course to solve a more complete programming problem using Java. It emphasizes proper logic design, structured code, and object-oriented principles.
